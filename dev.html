                        <p>Above, I placed the following:</p>
                        <pre>
    &lt;?php
        echo "This was created inside a php tag";
    ?&gt;
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>It did not render. This is because the <code>.php</code> file suffix is necessary, and does not exist here. This is true unless I can figure out how to tell the server to treat a <code>.html</code> file as php.</p>
                    <p>This was me trying to figure out if php works when inside of an <code>.html</code> file. </p>
                    <p>I do not feel like doing that.</p>
                    <p>An exact copy of this page exists as a <code>.php</code> file. This is to show where PHP does and does not work. </p>

                <p>This is some content change that I'm adding so that I can do approprate testing on mergify. 
                    I'm placing it here because this file, dev.html is hidden in the staging-content and main branches.
