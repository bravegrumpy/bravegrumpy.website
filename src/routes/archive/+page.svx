There are two types of archives, [sites](/archive/sites) and [content](/archive/content).

### Site Archive

The sites arhcive shows old versions of this site. While it does showcase the entier site, as it was, also includes a lot of other extraneous stuff, such as the styling, and random code that may or may not be useful.
I do no not provide any guarantee the links work.

### Content Archive

This is where I'm pplacing old content that I no longer stand by. This content may or may not have this design system.
