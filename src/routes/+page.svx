    <h4>Notes:</h4>

    <p>
      Be aware that this website is best viewed in a landscape (1440 x 1080) / hd display. I *do*
      have a mobile format, but it does not work as well. The small square to the right of the
      nav-links is a theme toggle. For some reason, the icon I placed in it are not showing up.
