    <h4>Notes:</h4>

    <p>
      Be aware that this website is best viewed in a landscape (1440 x 1080) / hd display. I *do*
      have a mobile format, but it does not work as well. The small square to the right of the
      nav-links is a theme toggle. For some reason, the icon I placed in it are not showing up.

## Types of Content

I only want people over the age of 18 to view this site. Adult content will have content warnings before they occur, but I also do not want to be liable for a minor reading the content of this website. 

Types of Adult Content Present

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| graphic sex / violence | creative writing, fan fiction, will be tagged ahead of time | WRITTEN | often drafts for or cross-posted on [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/), under the <q>Explicit</q> or <q>Creator chose Not to Use Archvie Warnings</q> tags.|
| veiled sexual references & innuendo | assets within renders | visual | Used as visual gags, or easter eggs. Often hidden or obscured. Not meant to be suggestive |
