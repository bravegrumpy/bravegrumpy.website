## Writing

There are two main types of writing that I do:

    - Fiction
    - Nonfiction.

Currently, the [Blog](/writing/blog) is where most of the non-fiction work is, and [Fantasy](/writing/huetopia) is where ficiton is.  This may grow as I have more ideas.

## Upcoming NSFW fanfiction projects

<div class="innerSection">

I am working on a different project. You can find it [here](/writing/fanfiction).
Be warned, that the material on the new project contains adult themes, and should be read with caution. Reader discretion is advised.
More specific content warnings will be on the main page there.

<Aside --asideHeight="fit-content" --asideRow="2/3" className="hidden">
The interesting thing about that project is that I made it using PHP, and LESS, wheras the rest of this site is written with Sveltejs.

I used PHP to generate the static site, and then put it in the static folder of my Sveltekit development environment.
