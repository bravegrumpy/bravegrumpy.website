<h5>Region-Of-Origin</h5>
<p>
  One of the ellipsoid tribes on the outskirts of the Great Circular Lake. This territory was taken
  over by the Triangle nation about one thousand years ago, so many of her nation's cultural
  practices have been influenced by Triangle culture. Most people have never heard of the ellipsoid
  tribes. Their lakes, the Ellipses, have since been renamed by the Triangles as the Angular
  Rivlettes.
</p>
<h6>Religions Within this Region</h6>
<p>
  The largest religion is an extremely old religion, Curl<sup id="ref3"><a href="#en3">3</a></sup> A
  subset of this religion eventually evolved into Draconian
</p>
<h5>Special Skills</h5>
<p>
  Character X knows the prayers, summoning the Dragon of the River, and many other spirits. She is
  skeptical, given that she has not seen any firsthand. She does not know that the visions come at a
  Color Magic Adept ceremony immediately after her Ph.D. graduation.
</p>
<h5>Occupation</h5>
<p>
  X is a student at The Academy. While her parents could pay the tuition, she also got a partial
  scholarship because of her unnaturally high color-magic powers.
</p>
<p>
  X eventually graduates, and becomes a historian, to right the incorrect record that Arch provided.
  K-ler is the author of this tale, and therefore almost everything will be colored through K-ler's
  her lens. The reader won't know that she is a her. Or much of what this is about.
</p>
<p>
  Her role as a narrator might come through when we read a book by Professor Arch, in the next
  volume.
</p>
<h5>Personality</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Secretive</li>
  <li>Analytical</li>
  <li>Quiet</li>
  <li>Shy</li>
  <li>Loyal to her friends</li>
  <li>Discerning</li>
</ul>
<h5>Attitudes about Euclidean School<sup id="ref4"><a href="#en4">4</a></sup></h5>
<p>
  Her peers thought she was super fun to be around and aspired to be like her. She schooled even the
  most athletic of her peers at sports and could be the life of the party. However, this extreme
  charisma never reached her eyes. She always thought she didn't fit in. However, part of it was the
  weight of keeping her community's secrets while at school. Acting like the perfectly trained
  Angular seemed fun but was exhausting.
</p>
<p>
  It is tough to hide her Ellipsoid roots when accidentally cursing. Great grandparents came from a
  time when it wasn't as essential to hide, so her grandparents and parents often used ellipsoid
  turns of phrases around the house.
</p>
<h5>If found in a coffee shop, what would they be doing? What would they be drinking?</h5>
<p>
  As a child, K-ler rarely went to coffee shops, as she would have rather been found climbing trees
  in the woods.
</p>
<p>
  When becoming an adult, and finding that she was meant to be a historian, she would go to coffee
  shops, and get the sweetest hot tea they had, usually orange, or lemon. She then would be seen
  with a stack of 3-5 well-worn books, a calligraphy pen, a pot of ink, and some paper. Even though
  most people would write with a [BrightLight], K-ler's tendency to be a color magic adept causes
  her to have this peculiar love for the pen and paper. Canonically, she is approximately 6
  generations younger than the cast of characters we will follow on this adventure, so much of the
  narrative is pieced together. (Apparently I as the “irl” Skylar am translation from Sinish)
</p>
<h5>When Flirting</h5>
<p>
  Skylar is not much of a flirt, and cannot tell if anybody is flirting with her. She also has some
  serious problems with generic Triagonal society, with the typical 3-parent, 9-kid generic life.
  She somehow ended up with only one life partner (Wildly unusual in her society), and her life
  partner is another femme (long hair no facial hair<sup id="ref5"><a href="#en5">5</a></sup>). That
  being said, she does dutifully record what primary sources tell her, so she will record
  relationships properly.
</p>
<h5>What does her room look like</h5>
<p>
  Even though she comes off as disheveled when dressing, she actually keeps her living space
  pristine. Her bedroom has a single bed tucked in the corner farthest from the door, on a metal bed
  frame, and no headboard. Her and her partner insist on keeping separate sleeping spaces, as to not
  annoy each other. At the head of her bead, at height about 2 feet above where her head rests, when
  sitting up in bed, there is a shelf. On the shelf, there is a collection of blue and grey painting
  supplies. Above the shelf, there is a rectangular patch that is constantly being painted. Right
  now, there is half of an oceanic scene, covering some partial runes that are part of a sleeping
  spell. Known only to her, and Ellipsoid people, this oceanic scene is also a more powerful
  sleeping spell.
</p>
<p>
  In the other corner, adjacent to the head of the bed, there is a wire rack, with a set of hangars,
  with clothing neatly hung up. Beside the rack, there is a wooden drawer set. Between the drawers
  and the bed, there is a window, with bright yellow shears, to allow plenty of light through.
</p>
<p>
  Across from the window, lies a writing desk with a tablet, a cup full of pens, and a pad of paper.
  In the righthand drawer of the writing desk, she keeps a set of empty pads, and below that lives a
  filing cabinet. To the right of the desk, lives an overflowing bookcase. Each shelf is stuffed
  completely, and stacked above the bookcase, there are three piles of neatly stacked books.
</p>
<p>
  Wrapping around the whole room, skipping the painting, there are floating shelves, also all filled
  with books, however these books are held up using some metal bookends. At the bottom of each shelf
  (including the bookcase) there are neatly handwritten labels, describing the genre of book that
  lives here. If closely inspected, each of the books are organized by the author's middle name in
  each section. Upon closer inspection, one would notice that at the top of each book, just above
  the binding, there are some markers, there for possibly some organization purpose, unknown to
  anybody other that K-ler.
</p>
<h5>Story Role</h5>
<p>
  K-Ler is a narrative foil to Professor Arch. She will also foreshadow the big reveal that the
  TriVerment is a dystopian government rather than a generic, ignorable entity. She is the one
  student who knows that Sikland is not homogeneous and that the cultures of Sikland are not
  entirely dead. It is also essential that K–Ler is never a POV character, unless K-Ler is the
  author. However, if K-Ler is the narrator, then she would not actually exist within the narrative
  at all, but will show signs of being a biased narrator.
</p>
<h5>Skylar's response to Professor Arch's About Me assignment</h5>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em>Skylar has two different answers to these questions. The Genuine Answer give X's
  honest response, and Record Answer gives the response that X would actually turn into Professor
  Arch. These Recorded Answers are approximately equivalent stereotypical answers a disgruntled
  Triangle would give. However, a future character will give genuine Triangle responses.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>What shall I call you?</strong>
    <p><em>Genuine Response:</em> K-ler is fine, I guess</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What is your favorite food?</strong>
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response: </em>Uhhh, anchovy dip. Slicings<sup id="ref6"><a href="#en6">6</a></sup
      >, I cannot say that. It is too elliptical.
    </p>
    <p><em>Recorded Response:</em> My favorite food is pizza.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do you like peanut butter?</strong>
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response:</em> I utterly hate peanut butter. It is the most disgusting linear dish
      I've ever eaten, and I do not understand why it is a delicacy. But to each their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Recorded Response: </em> Peanut butter is a delicacy that the Linarians developed to help the
      Triangle Tribes a stable food source, and therefore it is simply patriotic to enjoy it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Where are you from?</strong>
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response: </em>I grew up in Sikland, near the Great Circular Lake, near the
      Ellipses. I grew up riding niads, and praying to the serpents. I mean I call it Sikland,
      because it is in all of the maps, but my ancestors actually call it Areneae.
    </p>
    <p><em>Recorded Response: </em>I grew up in the Siklandish region of Triangle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What color do you most commonly use on your BrightLight?</strong>
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response: </em>Blue<sup id="ref7"><a href="#en7">7</a></sup>, duh. I pair blues
      with greens in a spiral pattern, to coax the fish out of the Ellipses. Doesn't everybody know
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Recorded Response: </em>A yellow-green<sup id="ref8"><a href="#en8">8</a></sup> hue, so I can
      eat healthily.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What is your native language?</strong>
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response: </em>Well, at home we speak Sinish<sup id="ref9"
        ><a href="#en9">9</a></sup
      >. But when we are searching for spirits, our prayers are in Asym<sup id="ref10"
        ><a href="#en10">10</a></sup
      >. Something tells me I am not quite good enough at Asym pronunciation, because I haven't yet
      seen anything. However, most people are not good enough at Asym, as there have been no
      apparitions in thousands of years. But I can hope that maybe I or one of my offspring might be
      good enough to meet a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Recorded Response: </em>I've only ever spoken Sinish. During Euclidian School, I learned
      some Linarian, but I was never very good.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Why are you interested in History?</strong>
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response: </em>Ughhh, I mean, I'm only taking this class so that I can become an
      Artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Recorded Response: </em>It is my patriotic duty to understand those who came before me, so
      that I further the Great Triangular Nation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What is your favorite hobby?</strong>
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response: </em>I love to paint. It clears my mind, and it allows me to access
      magic from my ancestors. <br /> Additionally, I enjoy making fish stew with my grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Recorded Response: </em>I enjoy playing frisbee, and eating Hamentashen<sup id="ref11"
        ><a href="#en11">11</a></sup
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >If the Triverment were to fall, and you had to pick a nation to be loyal to, what would you
      choose?</strong
    >
    <p>
      <em>Genuine Response: </em>I would slice-a-plane<sup id="ref12"><a href="#en12">12</a></sup>
      run away from this torus<sup id="ref13"><a href="#en13">13</a></sup>, and find a place where I
      can paint, without having to deal with the ramifications.
    </p>
    <p><em>Recorded Response: </em>I would stay loyal to the remnants of Triangle society.</p>
  </li>
