<h3>Chapter One Outline</h3>
<p>
  Chapter one will be broken into three sections. Each one will focus on the point of view of a
  character as they interact with a relatively dull life within their region. This will set up a
  status quo, a Chekov's gun, and a way for the reader to become acclimated to the most familiar
  version of Huetopia.

  It will start by showing two characters, Lytea and Sam, on the Quartano estate, arguing about a
  tree they used to play in as children. This tree grew in a swamp on the outskirts of the estate
  and has some old Linarian colors attached to it. Lytea and Sam aren't entirely sure of the
  significance of the Wallowing Willow. However, they both have access to colors rarely seen since
  the Time of Story and think they are the only ones who know about the Willow. This argument came
  up because they each had some very similar points brought up to them in the feedback Professor
  Arch gave about their Ph.D. proposals. While both Lytea and Sam applied to study history, they did
  not expect to get into the focus area of color magic. Lytea thinks this isn't a big deal and
  mentions that she talked about the tree in her proposal essay. Sam, colored by his Siklandish
  heritage, thinks that the Wallowing Willow might have had an effect and should have been kept a
  secret. This argument is supposed to foreshadow the fact that Professor Arch has dubious
  intentions, even though he is overtly being exceptionally kind and helpful in this book.

  While Professor Arch does not appear in this chapter, he is a topic of dinner conversation when
  Lytea is eating dinner with her family. This is an opportunity to show the opulence of a high
  Linarian home. For the Quartanos, it is normal to have staff serve them in the homeliest dinner
  hall, which shows more wealth than Sam's entire extended family could afford in 10 lifetimes. Sam
  works as a server in the Quartano Casual Kitchenette, so Sam is present for the conversation about
  Lytea's upcoming studies under Professor Arch. Ceil Ling Para Quartano is the top-point<sup
    id="ref15"><a href="#en15">15</a></sup
  > of his branch of the Quartano family. Ceil also references that the Quartanos are sponsoring Sam's
  education. Ceil would only ever do this if Sam were getting an excellent and potentially profitable
  education, and Professor Arch's reputation fits these requirements.

  The second section of the chapter will focus on the life of Agent Aster, an old friend of
  Professor Arch, from the days that they were Asym and Aster together. Right now, Aster is the head
  of Internal Affairs in the TriVerment. He is also taking on the project of auditing Professor
  Arch's curriculum. As the head, he would usually delegate this sort of task to a Scalene<sup
    id="ref16"><a href="#en16">16</a></sup
  >. This section of the chapter will show Agent Aster in a dinner conversation with his unionship
  partners<sup id="ref17"><a href="#en17">17</a></sup> and three children. Aster is as much a Checkov's
  gun as he is a character. He is introduced in chapter one as an introduction to Triangle society and
  politics. He then will show up a couple times in Professor Arch's class as a reminder that Triangle
  Society is inherently oppressive. As a Checkov's gun, he will then be fired when Professor Arch's intentions
  are revealed.

  The third part of the chapter will focus on Thalia. She is from Beyond the Zig Zag Pass, living as
  an immigrant in Sikland. Thalia will work with Lytea and Sam on the color-magic Ph.D. project. She
  grew up on the outskirts of a small fishing town in eastern Sikland. When younger, she would
  sometimes hear secrets of the Siklish people because her mother owned a cafe. Draconians (a
  minority religious group) were comfortable speaking openly in the cafe because Thalia's mother
  “couldn't afford” BrightLight surveillance and had a back room for private conversations. Thalia
  relocated to the outskirts of The Academy's Township, so she could wait tables to put herself
  through school. The part of the chapter will follow her during a typical day, waiting tables and
  stashing away tips so she can prepare to buy whatever supplies will be needed.
