### It Just F**ing Works

I try not to move to the whims of every new javascript invention.  Postgres exists for a reason.  I tried out this new database system called [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/).  Apparently the entire thing is in typescript.  

It does confuse me, however it just seems to work with my aws amplify hosting.  

However, doing this reminded me that there is one other thing to try....

I should add my railway urls to being acceptable cross origin domains.
