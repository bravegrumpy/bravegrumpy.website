# bravegrumpy
This repo is for the hello-world website, and nothing else

I will be using this site to experiment with JavaScript and to experiment with
the best methodology for publishing it to the domain: bravegrumpy.com

## Usage Notes:
- accessed through: <https://bravegrumpy.com>
- [sketchbook](https://bravegrumpy.com/helloWorld/helloWorld_html.html)
    - This is a sketchbook, where I follow my creativity.
- [Free Code Camp Projects](https://bravegrumpy.com/FreeCodeCamp/CatPhotoApp/index.html)
    - This is following a curriculum provided by [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org)
    - These projects give guidance as to how to use things that might be implemented in the sketchbook.
