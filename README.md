# bravegrumpy

This repo is for the hello-world website, and nothing else

I will be using this site to experiment with JavaScript and to experiment with
the best methodology for publishing it to the domain: bravegrumpy.com

## Notes

- [x] Right now, I own the domain bravegrumpy.com
- [x] I purchased it through Route 53 in AWS
- [x] I have DNS systems in place
- [x] __Publication with Amplify complete__

I know I haven't updated this readme in a while. Here are some highlights:

- [x] Moved most of the previous BraveGrumpy content into an archive folder with no direct link.
- [x] Structured the site to follow the Coursera Week-by-week format
- [x] Added in the navbar and menus necessary to navigate the site
- [x] added in `construction` class so I can have placeholders for future work.
- [x] Linked to these pages within Coursera, so I can give future readers context.
- [x] Ensured that the archive exists, so that I can merge huetopia into the main branch.
- [x] Made the main production branch pull from huetoipia:
  - [x] [Production Site](https://www.bravegrumpy.com)
  - [x] Created another pointer: [Huetopia Branch](https://huetopia.bravegrumpy.com) which shows identical content to the production branch at the moment.
  - [x] The main branch can at any time be reverted, and the huetopia branch will still persist.
- [x] Ensured that the svg files included on the site are pure svg, and not inkscape-svg. 

#### December 16<sup>th</sup>

#### December 14<sup>th</sup>
