# bravegrumpy
This repo is for the hello-world website, and nothing else

I will be using this site to experiment with JavaScript and to experiment with
the best methodology for publishing it to the domain: bravegrumpy.com

## Notes:
- Right now, I own the domain bravegrumpy.com
- I purchased it through Route 53 in AWS
- I have DNS systems in place
- the actual publication is hard.


## Change-Log
