# bravegrumpy

This repo is for the hello-world website, and nothing else

I will be using this site to experiment with JavaScript and to experiment with
the best methodology for publishing it to the domain: bravegrumpy.com

## Notes

### 2025

#### January

##### 24th

- [x] Bringing practice repo to this one. This one also deploys, so I can
      migrate to this.

- [x] I moved the contents from the
      [svelte.bravegrumpy.website repo](https://dev.svelte.bravegrumpy.com) into
      the main bravegrumpy repo. This should be pretty usable as a framework for
      porting existing content.

### 2024

#### October

##### 18th

- [ ] I am doing the gatsby tutorial, to see if I can implement some of the
      figma design I made.

##### 2nd

- This is likely the last iteration of this website without using some sort of
  javascript frontend framework.

I want to look into what adapters exist in node that can allow me to connect
javascript and python.

### 2022

- [x] Right now, I own the domain bravegrumpy.com
- [x] I purchased it through Route 53 in AWS
- [x] I have DNS systems in place
- [x] **Publication with Amplify complete**

## Change-Log

### 2024

#### October 20 `<sup>`th `</sup>`

- [x] Enacted actual semver. Each change to this branch, will increment the
      "patch" version number.
- [x] I'm still very much in the "unstable relases" world with this.
- [x] Clearly, the dev branch is where theh svelte inclusion is happening.
- [ ] Figure out the right way to document code.
- [ ] I also think that ultimately starting over with sveltekit, and being
      intentional with all of the routes, etc will be the way I implement js
      stuff.
- [ ] figure out how many merges have gone into main, and then bump the versions
      accordingly.

### 2022

#### December 29`<sup>`th`</sup>`

I know I haven't updated this readme in a while. Here are some highlights:

- [x] Moved most of the previous BraveGrumpy content into an archive folder with
      no direct link.
- [x] Structured the site to follow the Coursera Week-by-week format
- [x] Added in the navbar and menus necessary to navigate the site
- [x] added in `construction` class so I can have placeholders for future work.
- [x] Linked to these pages within Coursera, so I can give future readers
      context.
- [x] Ensured that the archive exists, so that I can merge huetopia into the
      main branch.
- [x] Made the main production branch pull from huetoipia:
  - [x] [Production Site](https://www.bravegrumpy.com)
  - [x] Created another pointer:
        [Huetopia Branch](https://huetopia.bravegrumpy.com) which shows
        identical content to the production branch at the moment.
  - [x] The main branch can at any time be reverted, and the huetopia branch
        will still persist.
- [x] Ensured that the svg files included on the site are pure svg, and not
      inkscape-svg.

#### December 16`<sup>`th`</sup>`

- [ ] Insert something?

#### December 14`<sup>`th`</sup>`

- [ ] I hope to refactor so that Huetopia is my main landing page. Otherwise, I
      might see what I can do about adding another subdomain for Huetopia. I
      don't want to actually trash all of my work, but I also want to hide the
      majority of the archive from public viewing.

#### December 11`<sup>`th`</sup>`

-[x] Added in all Huetopia content.

- [x] Successfully implemented responsive web design.

#### December 10`<sup>`th`</sup>`
